# COVID-19-Analysis

The report is an overview across the global spread of COVID-19.

In this project, I will demonstrate how to analyze the COVID-19 dataset using Power BI. The dataset provides a wide range of statistics about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across different countries and regions. This will showcase how Power BI can be used to extract valuable insights, trends, and comparisons from raw data.

The goal is to demonstrate the utilization of multiple visual elements, interactivity features, and in-depth insights into the data.

# Report Insights

The dataset contains COVID-19 statistics from various countries, including metrics such as:

Confirmed cases

Deaths

Recovered cases

Active cases

New cases and deaths

Deaths/100 cases

Recovered/100 cases

One-week change

The project aims to create an interactive and insightful report using Power BI, leveraging various visualizations to present the data in a meaningful and engaging way.

A variety of chart types and visuals such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and tables are used to convey insights effectively.

Use of buttons for navigation between report pages and bookmarks for specific views.

Integration of relevant designs to enhance the user experience and design aesthetics.

Clear titling, consistent color schemes, and an organized format for better readability.

The report provides in-depth insights into COVID-19 trends, such as recovery rates, death rates, active cases, and country-specific growth.
